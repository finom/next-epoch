# Worker Service

Web Worker feature provided by Vovk.ts is intended to popularise Web Worker usage in your every day coding. The standard Web Workers are awesome but they require to write additional logic by using `onmessage` handler on both sides (main thread and Woker thread) and exchange data using `postMessage`. Vovk.ts applies the same principle that is used at controllers and builds main-thread client-side library using the auto-generated **.vovk.json**. It uses built-in browser API aush as `addEventListener` and `postMessage` and does not utilise `eval` or `Function` constructor.

Worker Service can be easily created from an Isomorphic Service. Reminder: Isomorphic Service is a static class that provides code that is shared between front-end and back-end. It should implement functions as static methods that don't have access to neither application state nor server-side capabilities such as database access. More information about Isomorphic Services can be found at !!!!! architecture docs.

To define required `onmessage` handlers use `@worker()` decorator.

```ts
// /src/modules/hello/HelloWorkerService.ts
import { worker } from 'vovk';

@worker()
export default class HelloWorkerService {
    static heavyCalculation(iterations: number) {
        let result: number;
        // ... heavy calculations

        return result;
    }
}
```

In a non-worker environment `@worker()` does nothing. You can import the Isomorphic Service class safely in other modules as usually (on back-end, for example).

To make workers information available on the main thread, you need to pass them to
`initVovk` as `workers` option.


```ts
// /src/app/api/[[...vovk]]/route.ts
import { initVovk } from 'vovk';
import HelloController from '../../../hello/HelloController';
import HelloWorker from '../../../hello/HelloWorker';
import ByeWorker from '../../../bye/ByeWorker';

const controllers = { HelloController };
const workers = { HelloWorker, ByeWorker };

export type Controllers = typeof controllers;
export type Workers = typeof workers;

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = initVovk({ controllers, workers });
```


Once this is done, **vovk-client** exports the main-thread Worker Service library that provides interface to invoke heavy calculations but doesn't initialise Web Worker itself. To plug-in the worker to the main-thread worker interface it needs to be initialised and passed as an argument of `use` static method.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

HelloWorker.use(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));
```

Unfortunately this bulky syntax in unavoidable and required to invoke internal Webpack loaders provided by Next.js. After it's done the Worker static methods return `Promise` to delegate heavy calculations to the parallel thread.

```ts
const result = await HelloWorker.heavyCalculation(1e9);
```

Note that `Worker` class does not exist in Next.js SSR environment and in case if the code is exposed to non-client-side environment (for example outside of `useEffect`) it's recommended to check `Worker` for existence.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

if(typeof Worker !== 'undefined') {
    HelloWorker.use(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));
}
```

`use` method returns the worker interface itself so as a nicer solution you can use ternary operator to make the Worker library nullish.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

const MyWorker = typeof Worker === 'undefined' 
    ? null 
    : HelloWorker.use(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));

await MyWorker?.heavyCalculation(1e9);
```

## Worker termination

A worker can be terminated with built-in `terminate` method.

```ts
worker.terminate();
```

## Async generators

Worker Service supports generators and async generators to implement continious event streaming. 

```ts
// /src/modules/hello/HelloWorker.ts
import { worker } from 'vovk';

@worker()
export default class HelloWorkerService {
    static *generator() {
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            yield i;
        }
    }

    static async *asyncGenerator() {
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
            yield i;
        }
    }
}
```

Vovk.ts turns them both into an async generator.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

// ... plug in the Web Worker with "use" method ...

for await (const number of HelloWorker.generator()) {
    console.log(number); // 0 ... 9
}

for await (const number of HelloWorker.asyncGenerator()) {
    console.log(number); // 0 ... 9
}
```

## Making HTTP requests inside a Worker Service

Since Web Workers are run in a browser (but just in another thread) it's capable to fetch server-side data as usually.

```ts
// /src/modules/hello/HelloController.ts
import { get } from 'vovk';

export class HelloController {
    @get.auto()
    static getIterations() {
        return { iterations: 100_000_000 };
    }
}
```

```ts
// /src/modules/hello/HelloWorker.ts
import { HelloController } from 'vovk-client';

@worker()
export default class HelloWorker {
    static private helloController = HelloController;

    static async heavyCalculation() {
        const { iterations } = await this.helloController.getIterations();
        let result: number;

        // ...

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Using Worker Service inside another Worker Service

Workers can use other workers. The syntax remains the same and you don't need to check `Worker` existence.

```ts
import { AnotherWorker } from 'vovk-client';

export default class WorkerService {
    private static anotherWorker = AnotherWorker;

    heavyCalculation() {
        const anotherWorkerResult = await this.anotherWorker.doSomethingHeavy();
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Fork the Worker

To fork the worker and create as many parallel processes as needed you can use `fork` method instead of `use`.

```ts
import { HelloWorker } from 'vovk-client';

function getFork() {
    return HelloWorker.fork(new Worker(new URL('./path/to/HelloWorker.ts', import.meta.url)));
}

const HelloWorker1 = getFork();
const HelloWorker2 = getFork();
const HelloWorker3 = getFork();

const [result1, result2, result3] = await Promise.all([
    HelloWorker1.heavyCalculation(),
    HelloWorker2.heavyCalculation(),
    HelloWorker3.heavyCalculation(),
]);
```
